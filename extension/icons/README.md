# Extension Icons

This folder should contain three icon files for the Chrome extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Icons

### Option 1: Online Generators
- Search for "Chrome extension icon generator"
- Upload a base image and generate all sizes
- Download and place in this folder

### Option 2: Image Editor
- Use any image editor (GIMP, Photoshop, Canva, etc.)
- Create a square image (at least 128x128)
- Export/resize to all three sizes
- Save as PNG files

### Option 3: Placeholder (Testing)
- For testing, you can use any PNG files
- Just ensure they're named correctly
- Replace with proper icons before publishing

## Icon Design Tips

- Use simple, recognizable designs
- Ensure icons are clear at small sizes
- Use high contrast colors
- Avoid text (hard to read at 16x16)
- Match YouTube's design aesthetic (optional)

## Quick Test Icons

If you need quick test icons, you can:
1. Create a simple colored square in Paint
2. Save as PNG
3. Copy and rename to all three sizes
4. Replace later with proper icons

The extension will work with placeholder icons, but you'll need proper icons for Chrome Web Store submission.
